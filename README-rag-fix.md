# Fixed RAG issues and created test scripts

## Issues Fixed

1. Restored missing Azure OpenAI settings in settings.py
2. Created test scripts to verify RAG with POLA queries

## How to Test

Use one of these scripts to test the RAG functionality:

```bash
# Test through the entire graph (full simulation)
python test-rag-message.py

# Test just the RAG chain directly with POLA queries
python test-pola-query.py
```

Note: These tests only verify the RAG system is working properly but don't add any content to the vector store. If no documents are found, you will need to populate the 'Information' collection in Qdrant.

## RAG System Status

The RAG system has been fixed and should now work properly with the settings from the .env file. However, the tests show:

1. The Qdrant connection is working correctly
2. The RAG query processing is working correctly
3. The vector embeddings are generating correctly
4. The 'Information' collection in Qdrant appears to be empty, which is why no results are found

## Next Steps

To make the RAG system fully functional with POLA card queries, you'll need to:

1. Populate the 'Information' collection with relevant documents about POLA cards
2. Use the provided test scripts to verify the documents are being retrieved correctly

No changes are needed to the code itself - the implementation is correct but needs data to work with.
