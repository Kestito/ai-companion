## Response Analysis

### Test 1: Basic Text Message Response

**Input Message:**
```

- Workflow type: 'conversation' (default flow)
- Response length: 70 characters 
- Response was successfully sent to chat ID 67890
- The bot used the appropriate casual, friendly tone for a greeting

### Test 2: Command Message Response

**Input Message:**
```
/schedule tomorrow at 2pm Reminder for doctor appointment
```

**Output Response:**
```
I've scheduled your reminder for tomorrow at 2:00 PM.
```

**Analysis:**
- The bot correctly identified this as a command message starting with "/"
- Workflow type: 'schedule' (special command handler)
- Response length: 53 characters
- Response was successfully sent to chat ID 67890
