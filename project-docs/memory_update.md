# Memory System Update - May 2025

## Overview

This document describes the update to the memory storage system to use Supabase exclusively, eliminating the need for SQLite database files.

## Changes

1. Fixed the settings.py file to properly set `SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` to None and always use Supabase
2. Updated all interfaces to utilize the memory_service for standardized memory operations
3. Removed all direct SQLite database access and dependencies
4. Ensured proper patient ID tracking across all interfaces

## Issues Fixed

1. **Message History Retrieval**
   - Problem: Short-term memory wasn't correctly retrieving conversation history.
   - Solution: Implemented direct database querying in the memory_injection_node to bypass the embedding search for recent messages.

2. **Context JSON Parsing**
   - Problem: The context column in the short_term_memory table had varied formats (JSON strings, raw values).
   - Solution: Added robust JSON parsing with fallbacks to handle different data formats.

3. **Message Formatting**
   - Problem: Messages weren't formatted consistently in a way useful for the AI.
   - Solution: Implemented structured User/Assistant/System message formatting for clear conversation history.

4. **SQLite Database Dependencies**
   - Problem: The application was creating local SQLite database files which caused permission issues.
   - Solution: Removed all SQLite database dependencies and updated integrations to use Supabase exclusively.

## Implementation Details

1. Updated the memory manager to use Supabase exclusively
2. Removed AsyncSqliteSaver references from the codebase
3. Added proper error handling for memory operations
4. Set USE_SUPABASE_FOR_MEMORY flag to True throughout the application

## Recent Fixes (2025-05-12)

1. Found and deleted SQLite database files that were still being created:
   - Removed `data/short_term_memory.db`
   - Removed `src/data/short_term_memory.db`

2. Updated interfaces to ensure exclusive Supabase usage:
   - WhatsApp interface: Removed SQLite checkpoint references
   - Chainlit interface: Removed AsyncSqliteSaver import
   - Verified Supabase connectivity across all interfaces

3. Fixed test scripts to validate Supabase memory storage:
   - Updated test_memory_fix.py to use valid UUIDs for patient IDs
   - Verified memory retrieval works correctly from Supabase

4. Memory storage and retrieval now works with Supabase exclusively for all interfaces:
   - Web
   - Telegram
   - WhatsApp
   - Chainlit

## Testing

We created comprehensive test scripts:

1. **test_memory_injection.py**
   - Tests the full memory injection process
   - Verifies handling of different patient records
   - Confirms proper message formatting for both JSON and non-JSON data

2. **test_short_term_memory.py**
   - Tests the direct Supabase connections
   - Confirms schema structure
   - Verifies query results with both valid and problematic data

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Validated WhatsApp and Telegram interfaces work correctly with Supabase
   - Ensured web interface correctly identifies and manages patient records

## Documentation

Added detailed documentation of the memory system:

1. **project-docs/memory.md**
   - Architecture overview
   - Component descriptions
   - Implementation details
   - Error handling strategies

## Future Improvements

1. **Schema Standardization**
   - Consider standardizing the short_term_memory schema to use a consistent format
   - Add migration scripts to convert existing data to the standard format

2. **Cache Layer**
   - Add a caching layer to improve performance for frequent memory accesses
   - Implement TTL-based cache invalidation

3. **Pagination**
   - Add support for pagination to retrieve more than 5 messages when needed
   - Implement cursor-based pagination for efficient retrieval of large history sets

4. **Long-term Memory Integration**
   - Improve integration between short-term and long-term memory systems
   - Develop strategies for moving short-term memories to long-term when appropriate

## Benefits

1. Eliminated permission issues related to SQLite file creation
2. Improved cross-platform compatibility
3. Centralized memory storage in a single database
4. Enhanced reliability with cloud-based storage
5. Simplified application deployment with fewer local dependencies
