## Progress Tracking

### Current Sprint Focus
- Debugging and optimizing RAG system components
- Enhancing error handling and monitoring
- Documenting system architecture and components
- Implementing performance improvements

### Key Performance Indicators
- RAG query success rate: 92% (Target: 95%)
