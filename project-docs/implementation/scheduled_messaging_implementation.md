#### Phase 1 Guidance

**Review Approach:**
1. **Start with telegram_bot.py**: This is the core file you'll integrate with. Focus on:
   - How message sending is implemented
   - Error handling patterns
   - Bot initialization and connection management
   - Existing async patterns if used

2. **Database Schema Analysis**:
   - Review the current scheduled_messages table
   - Determine if additional fields are needed for status tracking
   - Assess if message_delivery_attempts table should be created

3. **Requirements Documentation**:
   - Gather specific messaging requirements across platforms
   - Document expected message volumes and patterns
   - Identify any special message types (media, formatting, etc.)

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How does the current bot handle failures?
- What authentication mechanism is used for the Telegram API?
- Is the bot implementation thread-safe for shared usage?
- What schema changes are needed for delivery tracking?
- Are there any rate limits to consider?
