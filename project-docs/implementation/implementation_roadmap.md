## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All scheduled messages are delivered reliably within their delivery window
2. The system can handle the specified message volume with acceptable latency
3. Platform errors are properly handled with appropriate retry logic
4. Message status is accurately tracked and reported
5. Monitoring provides visibility into system performance and health
6. The system can be deployed and operated in production with minimal manual intervention

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Schema migration issues | Run migration in staging first, have rollback plan ready |
| Performance bottlenecks | Early load testing, metrics collection, incremental optimization |
| API limitations | Implement circuit breaker, respect rate limits, graceful degradation |
| Integration complexity | Clear interface definitions, comprehensive integration tests |
| Resource constraints | Prioritize features, focus on core functionality first |

## Conclusion

This implementation roadmap provides a structured approach to enhancing the scheduled messaging system with clear phases, deliverables, and timelines. The phased approach allows for incremental deployment of improvements while maintaining system stability throughout the implementation process.
